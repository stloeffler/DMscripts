# About

This repository contains scripts for [Gatan's](http://www.gatan.com/) [Microscopy Suite (GMS)](http://www.gatan.com/products/tem-analysis/gatan-microscopy-suite-software) Software a.k.a. DigitalMicrograph (DM).

DM is ubiquitous in transmission electon microscopy and has a powerful scripting engine that can be used to extend its functionality. A testing version of DM 2 can be obtained from [Gatan's website](http://www.gatan.com/products/tem-analysis/gatan-microscopy-suite-software) after a free registration.

Unless noted otherwise, all scripts in this repository were tested in GMS 2.32 and are licensed under the [GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).

# Directory Structure

This repository is laid out in the following way:

 - Debug Scripts: contains scripts I use for developing and analyzing scripts. They are not necessarily useful for the "average user".

 - Dialogs: contains scripts that provide extensions to the user interface, such as dialogs and palettes

 - Processing: contains scripts for processing data

 - Tutorials: contains snippets of code that are not necessarily very useful on  their own, but demonstrate different aspects of the scripting language, useful functions, etc.
